<p>This tutorial is still w.i.p, and might change once MCPE 0.10.5 is released</p>
<br></br>
<p>Modding on iOS is completly different from modding on Android. Most mods on Android uses a javascript api called ModPE. iOS had this before when MCPE 0.7.2 was released. However, that changed when Mojang removed the stuff that modders needed in order to mod, which was in 0.7.3. Modding was still possible, but it required alot of effort to find the function names and addresses, and the addresses change every version, so that would require even more effort updating mods.

<br></br>However, c0deh4cker managed to convince Tommaso to not strip the symbols in 0.9.4. That's when modding became alive again. That's also when I created my sneaking mod. Although iOS got symbols, it doesn't have as many symbols as Android has. That's because of the compiler optimizations merging some symbols into globals.
<br></br>
Currently, you can mod MCPE for iOS with substrate, mostly known as Cydia Substrate
<br></br>
This tutorial will use my newly made app to compile and install mods on-device. You can find my app on my new repo
